## Installation

You will need to generate a YouTube Data v3 API key in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). You can follow [this guide](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) to do so.

Once you have your API key, you can add it to your environment variables as `YT_API_KEY` or modify the `self.API_key` in `SongSearch` to your API key.
